International Space Station tracker

This small application will help you to check if ISS is visible at your location in real time.
What you need is just small preparation. Please do the things below:

1. Create new Google account and acquire its app password
(more about it here, but beware that you will need to turn of double verification;

2. Create account at https://www.weatherapi.com/ (for FREE)
3. Get information about latitude and longitude (for example with Google Maps)
4. Insert all that information needed in the code
5. Run the code. It will check ISS location every 30 sec and will send you email if ISS is visible
(not more than 3 emails).

The whole project was inspired by Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023", Udemy
course.
